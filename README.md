## Features

- **Smart Ticket Classification**: Automatically categorize incoming tickets based on their content, reducing manual effort and ensuring timely responses.
  
- **Predictive SLA Breach Alerts**: Receive alerts before a ticket breaches its SLA, allowing teams to take proactive measures.

- **Intelligent Agent Routing**: Route tickets to the most suitable agents based on their expertise and current workload.

- **Dashboards**: Gain insights into ticket trends, SLA performance, and agent efficiency through interactive dashboards.

- **No-Code Integration**: Easily integrate with JIRA without extensive coding knowledge.

- **Customizable Workflows**: Adapt the tool to fit your specific support processes.

## Technologies Used

This project employs a variety of technologies to deliver its features effectively:

- **Machine Learning**: For predictive analysis and classification.
- **Flask**: To create a lightweight web application for the API.
- **Python**: The primary programming language for backend logic.
- **JIRA API**: For integration with JIRA and ticket management.
- **Data Science Libraries**: Such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation and model training.
